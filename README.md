SnakeGL
=======

Inspired by [Tititesouris](https://twitter.com/Tititesouris) and his TwitchPlaysSnake project I decided to do my first bit of 'game programming' by making this version of Snake in Java.

I am using the [LWJGL](http://lwjgl.org/) for doing the OpenGL rendering of the game. All code was written on an Ubuntu 13.10 system and the source code (Eclipse workspace) assumes you are using the Linux natives for LWJGL. This can be very easily changed to point to the Windows or Mac natives in Eclipse.
